# Class 1: Sep 11, 2020

In this lesson we will practice bash and Git by learning to contribute to the SPIRL textbook!

## Pre-class homework

SPIRL Chapter 1 (Bash) and Chapter 2: (Git) were assigned.

## Itinerary

**(5 mins)** Wait for people to join / Zoom poll:

1. Did you do the pre-class homework? A: Yes, B: Ch1 only, C: Ch2 only, D: No, I didn't know about it, E: No, I didn't get a chance
2. Had you used Bash before the homework? A: A little, B: A lot, C: Nope
3. Had you used Git before the homework? A: A little, B: A lot, C: Nope

**(15 minutes)** Live demo

Step through how to contribute to a GitHub repository in two ways! First:

- Find the 2020 class folder on the repo (if you're reading this, you found it!)
- Fork the repo

Method 1: Command line

First we set up the textbook locally (see instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cjtu/spirl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md))

- Clone the repo
- Create conda env
- Activate conda env
- Build the textbook locally
- Check out the local textbook in browser

Now we make our first contribution:

- Make a branch
- Add a file to the `spirl/course/2020/week01` folder called `myinitials.md`
- Commit file
- Push change to GitHub
- Make pull request on the main repository on GitHub

Part 2: GitHub Desktop

- Same as above but with GUI!

**(25 minutes)** Breakout room practice

- Work through the above steps to get a clone of SPIRL on you computer, then make a pull request!
- Feel free to use the command line or try GitHub Desktop!
- Ask each other questions and make sure everyone is keeping up!
- Your goal is to make a pull request to add a new file, `myinitials.md`, to the main repository

**(15 minutes)** Debrief and Q&A

- How did it go?
- Did you use the command line or GitHub Desktop?
- What questions do you have about Git, Bash, misc?
- Would you feel comfortable using this for your own work? Why or why not?
