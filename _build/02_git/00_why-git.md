# Version control in Git

Has one of these happened to you?

- "I accidentally deleted all of my code and now I'm sad"
- "I broke something in my program and I can't remember how it was"
- "I don't know if I meant to send my collaborator `code_v3_oct31_2018_1_final.py` or `code_v3_nov7_2018_3.py`"
- "My friend changed half of my code, but I've updated it a bunch since I sent it to them months ago and now I don't know how to combine the two versions"

This section will give a practical introduction to version control with Git to mitigate some common challenges that we scientists face when dealing with code.
