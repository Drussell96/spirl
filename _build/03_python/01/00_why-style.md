# Why Worry About Python Style?
 
There's nothing worse than finding open source code on line that claims to do **exactly** what you need, and being unable to read it. Except perhaps having to spend hours figuring out how it works. One of the major advantages to coding in Python, as opposed to something like C++ is the high level of readablilty in "Pythonic" code. Python was designed to be more intuitive and human-readable than any language before it. However, there is plenty of Python code out there that is far from readable. Writing better, more Pythonic (most readable) code can be achieved by following the set of Code Style guidlines (Pep8). In this section we will cover ways of writing better Pythonic code and you will be well on your way to becoming a Pythonista.
