# Getting Started with SpIRL

This textbook is a collection of scientific programming concepts and practical examples for all scientists who code. It can be followed in order as a crash course in scientific programming, or used as a reference for specific topics.

## Why another learn-to-code resource?

Many "basic" programming courses contain a lot of programming jargon, and sometimes StackOverflow just doesn't cut it. We wanted to make a "by scientists, for scientists" resource that is open source and easy to refer back to in a pinch.

## How does it work?

If you work through this textbook from start to finish, it will read like a short programming course (course outline [here](../00_guide/02_schedule)). Alternatively, you can use the navigation bar on the left or [search](../search) for the concept you want to learn about.

Get stuck on a module or can't find what you're looking for? Make a suggestion on the project [issues board](https://github.com/cjtu/spirl/issues)!

## Programming is like speaking a language...

and languages take *practice*!

The best way to learn any language is by reading, writing and speaking it (i.e. actually running code). This book has a mix of text, code examples, and interactive code blocks. We encourage you to run the interactive code blocks, try the exercises on your computer and take advantage of the references if our explanations of the concepts aren't cutting it.
